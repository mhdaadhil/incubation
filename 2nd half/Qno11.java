/*11.The hiring team aims to find 3 candidates who are great collectively.
Each candidate has his or her ability expressed as an integer. 3
candidates are great collectively if product of their abilities is
maximum. Given abilities of N candidates in an array arr[], find the
maximum collective ability from the given pool of candidates.
Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {10, 3, 5, 6, 20}
Output: 1200
Explanation:
Multiplication of 10, 6 and 20 is 1200.
Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {-10, -3, -5, -6, -20}
Output: -90
Explanation:
Multiplication of -3, -5 and -6 is -90.
